    <para>The Neutron project provides virtual networking services
        among devices that are managed by the <link

            >OpenStack</link> compute service.</para>
    <para>The &APIv2; combines the <link
            xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-network/1.0/content/"
            >Quantum API v1.1</link> with some essential Internet
        Protocol Address Management (IPAM) capabilities from the <link
            xlink:href="http://melange.readthedocs.org/en/latest/apidoc.html"
            >Melange API</link>.</para>
    <para>These IPAM capabilities enable you to:</para>

            <para>Associate IP address blocks and other network
                configuration settings required by a network device,
                such as a default gateway and dns-servers settings,

        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>To do this, the &APIv2; introduces the subnet entity. A
        subnet can represent either an IP version 4 or version 6
        address block. Each OpenStack Networking network commonly has
        one or more subnets. When you create a port on the network, an
        available fixed IP address is allocated to it from one the
        designated subnets for each IP version. When you delete the
        port, the allocated addresses return to the pool of available
        IPs on the subnet. &APIv2; users can choose a specific IP
        address from the block or let OpenStack Networking choose the
        first available IP address.</para>

        <para>The high-level task flow for OpenStack Networking
            involves creating a network, associating a subnet with
            that network, and booting a VM that is attached to the
            network. Clean-up includes deleting the VM, deleting any
            ports associated with the network, and deleting the
            networks. OpenStack Networking deletes any subnets
            associated with the deleted network.</para>

        <title>Plug-ins</title>
        <para>Virtual networking services are implemented through a
            plug-in. A plug-in can use different techniques and
            technologies to provide isolated virtual networks to
            tenants. A plug-in also provides other services, such as
            IP address management. Because each plug-in implements all
            the operations included in &APIv2;, do not be concerned
            about which plug-in is used.</para>
        <para>However, some plug-ins might expose additional
            capabilities through API extensions, which this document
            discusses. For more information about the extensions
            exposed by a particular plug-in, see the plug-in
            documentation.</para>
